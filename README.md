## Merge Overlapping Intervals:

Task: Write a function that takes an array of intervals (represented as pairs [start, end]) and merges overlapping intervals.
Sample Input: [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Expected Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

## Rotate Array:

Task: Implement a function that rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps.

## Sample Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2

Expected Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

## Sum of Subarray Minimums:

Task: Create a function that returns the sum of the minimum values of all possible subarrays of a given array.

## Sample Input: [3, 1, 2, 4]

Expected Output: 17

## Longest Increasing Subsequence:

Task: Write a function that finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array of integers.

Sample Input: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]

Expected Output: 6

## Partition Labels:

Task: Implement a function that partitions a string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.
Sample Input: "abacbd"
Expected Output: [3, 3, 1]

## Combination Sum:

Task: Write a function that finds all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to a given target.
Sample Input: [2, 3, 6, 7], 7
Expected Output: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]

## Maximum Subarray Sum:

Task: Create a function that finds the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum.
Sample Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Expected Output: 6 (subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1])

## Word Search:

Task: Implement a function that determines if a word exists in a 2D board of characters. The word can be constructed from letters adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically.
Sample Input: board = [['A','B','C','E'],['S','F','C','S'],['A','D','E','E']], word = "ABCCED"
Expected Output: true

## Minimum Window Substring:

Task: Write a function that finds the minimum window in a string which contains all the characters of another string.
Sample Input: "ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC"
Expected Output: "BANC"

## Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums:

Task: Implement a function that returns the k pairs (u, v) with the smallest sums from two arrays nums1 and nums2.
Sample Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
Expected Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]
